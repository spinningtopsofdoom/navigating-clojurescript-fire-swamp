# Closure Library

## Lessons
- Standard library
- Google Closure Compatible
- Great vetting process
- Reach for library when needing something a standard library would do

## No JavaScript standard library
JavaScript definitely doesn't have batteries included
E.g. string functionality

## Closure Library
Hidden treasure great functionality that is very well hidden and hard to search for
Search Closure Library when needing functionality that would be standard in another language (e.g. Python, Ruby, Java)
Easy to integrate with also advanced compilation compatible

## Examples
xhr with old AJAX API or new Fetch API
`oncw` to run a functional only one time
`debounce`, `throttle`, `delay` with customizable Objects
`DateTime` `UTCDatwTime`, `Interval`
`URI`

## Third Party library interaction
`goog.object` contains operations for accessing JavaScript objects and collections
Safe in development mode and advanced mode
